Dear Sibylle,

Good morning Sweetheart. I love you.

The evening and weekend project I've been so absorbed with has been
setting up a text-based (command line) email client called "mutt." As of
last night shortly before we went up stairs for the night I had it
mostly working. So I'm giving it a try this morning. Because I can
access the interface to it remotely, it's actually running on the little
desktop computer in my office. It's nicely scratching a nerd itch for
me. :)

When I got up the outside temperature was 38° and the humidity was was
only 40%, so I opened the window. It's a bit breezy, but that's from the
west at the moment, so I hope the window isn't being too creaky.

Today is our bi-weekly all hands meeting. It's from 9:30 am until 11 am
on the calendar. Today is also a state-wide tornado drill at 10 am.
Otherwise my calendar is open.

I love you Sibylle. I wish you a peaceful morning and a beautiful day.
I love you,
Mark
