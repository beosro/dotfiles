Good sunny (VERY sunny!) Tuesday morning dear Mark. I love you.=20

I am glad you slept well. Another not so late bedtime tonight, and maybe =
a nap tomorrow afternoon when you don=E2=80=99t have a cello lesson - =
that=E2=80=99ll help with the healing.=20

Bootstrap continues to do his furious water splashing: this morning I =
have dried the tile (and wood) in front of the fireplace three times =
already. After the second time I emptied the water bowls to leave only a =
few millimeters of water in there - enough to drink but not enough to =
splash - or so I thought =E2=80=A6 And it didn=E2=80=99t take two =
minutes after I started cleaning the guest bathtub (where I had showered =
the calamondin orange), hosing it down, wiping it off, and he showed up, =
waiting for me to finish so he could jump in and drink the water =E2=80=A6=
=20

I would like to try to attend the concert tonight. Slawomir had =
mentioned it in an email, saying =E2=80=9CPlease come.=E2=80=9D  I =
don=E2=80=99t know the program but I expect it=E2=80=99ll be a =
world-class performance. For dinner I may make something that I can =
drink, maybe in the car, so I don=E2=80=99t have to fiddle with food in =
my braces after eating =E2=80=A6 I would love for you to come with me =
but of course I understand if you are tired after a long day plus lesson =
and would just like to be home.=20

I love you, Sweetheart, and I wish you a good morning.=20

I love you,
Sibylle=20
