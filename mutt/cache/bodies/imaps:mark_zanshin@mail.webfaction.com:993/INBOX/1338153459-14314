Good morning dear Mark, I love you.

The window wasn't too creaky but because the wind is gusty it 
occasionally rattled it. I couldn't believe it when you said "snow" but 
here it is ... Tiny snowflakes swirling in the air. Spring may be around 
the corner but it's not here quite yet ... Though the bulbs I planted 
don't seem to care: there is a protected spot by the back door stoop 
where I planted some of those miniature daffodils - and one has a bud 
already!  Yay :)

I love you.

Thank you for waffles last night! It was yummy, delicious, and very 
satisfying. It is hard not to overeat.

Should I tell Taz that there is a mutt in your office??

I was curled up when I woke up and when I tried to stretch my legs there 
was something in the way - a cat, which isn't unusual, so I moved over a 
bit and tried again - and there was another something in the way - TWO 
cats on the bed. Bootstrap was ready for his breakfast, came with me in 
the kitchen and ate what I prepared for him right there and then. So 
far, Bootstrap is not interested in the Pro Plan canned food, and Taz 
doesn't seem interested in the Hill's Diet kidney food, so this may 
actually work out just fine.

Tornado drill in the snow - you get to go down into the basement? Fire 
drill wouldn't be much fun today because you would have to leave the 
building, right? (Let's not jinx it and mention fire minus drill.)

I love you, Sweetheart. Very much. I wish you a good morning with a good 
= productive meeting.

I love you :)
Sibylle

      The evening and weekend project I've been so absorbed with has
      been
      <br>
      setting up a text-based (command line) email client called "mutt."
      As of

      <br>
      mostly working. So I'm giving it a try this morning. Because I can

      me. :)

      When I got up the outside temperature was 38° and the humidity was

      only 40%, so I opened the window. It's a bit breezy, but that's

      <br>
      <br>
      Today is our bi-weekly all hands meeting. It's from 9:30 am until
      11 am
      <br>
      on the calendar. Today is also a state-wide tornado drill at 10
      am.
