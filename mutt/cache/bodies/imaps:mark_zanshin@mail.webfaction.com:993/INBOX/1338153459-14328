Good morning dear Mark, I love you.

I don't know why, but for some reason I opened my eyes (while you were 
getting dressed?) and saw a beautiful and very red glow on the wall so I 
jumped out of bed, grabbed the phone and took at picture of the sun just 
peeking over the horizon. - Changing to daylight-NOT-savings time is 
coming up, soon, isn't it? Then it'll be back to sunrise at 8 ...

I love you :)

I am glad you are able to sleep. It's such an important thing. Dr. Weil 
the other day mentioned a "sleep and dream" supplement - I was surprised 
that he would include dream, and I may take a closer look and see how he 
addresses the dream part of sleep (in a supplement).

I think between the Wellbutrin and the menopause supplement (for 
concentration and mood, I think), plus the extra protein, I have more 
energy. Of course it helps that I have so much control over my job, 
business, so that that doesn't eat up my energy.

You had mentioned that your depression - unlike mine - manifests itself 
through anger. Do you perhaps feel less angry now that the Wellbutrin 
(probably) has kicked in?

Jonathan has a friend / colleague who just lost her husband (two weeks 
ago) after an ugly illness (cancer? I don't remember), and he says she 
has unexpected trouble with anger: she used to be pretty even-keeled but 
now she has almost trouble controlling her anger at / with patients.

I am so grateful that we live in Kansas where the sun shines all the 
time. The studio right now is not bright, because I lowered the blinds 
to protect the pianos, but I can see bright light on the wall of the 
patio, and there is some sun on the floor (in the studio). All of which 
helps my mood.

I think we have all the papers for Gary now. Do you have a preference 
for day / time for an appointment?

I love you, and I wish you a good morning, Sweetheart.

I love you.
Sibylle

      Good morning Sweetheart. I love you.
      <br>
      <br>
      You were up before the sun today, or at least up with the sun
      today. :) I hope
      <br>
      you had a restful night. Once again I was awake early and fell
      back asleep. I'm
      <br>
      not sure what else the Wellbutrin is doing for me, but it is
      easing my sleep.
      <br>
      Which is good.
      <br>
      <br>
      I think I have mutt email largely figured out. The one thing that
      I still need
      <br>
      to sort out is how it formats lines in the mail itself. These
      lines should look
      <br>
      okay on your Rose Gold laptop or at your desktop, but on your
      iPhone the line
      <br>
      endings are probably somewhat jagged; one line truncated and the
      next just a
      <br>
      work or two long, repeated throughout the mail. It's a work in
      progress.
      <br>
      <br>
      The last time I walked at work on a weekend, I rearranged the
      monitors on my
      <br>
      sitting desk. I've got three monitors there: two 27" and one 24".
      I centered
      <br>
      them (more or less), with one 27" dead ahead, one 27" to the
      right, and the 24"
      <br>
      to the left. Somehow it isn't working. I find that I am having to
      swivel my
      <br>
      head more, and farther, than I would like. I'm going to try
      scooting them
      <br>
      farther away on my desk to see if that helps at all. If it doesn't
      I may
      <br>
      (gasp!) turn off the 24" monitor and just use the two 27" ones. A
      nice  1st
      <br>
      world problem to have.
      <br>
      <br>
      Today I have stand up at 8:45 am, and then I'm going to listen in
      to the weekly
      <br>
      ITS Collaboration meeting from 9 - 10 am. This afternoon there is
      a short,
      <br>
      online meeting. Quite a while ago, when we were still WSEs, we did
      a
      <br>
      "strengths" test that came up with five descriptive words for each
      of us. Mine
      <br>
      were: Deliberative, Analytical, Relator, Individualization, Input.
      Each of
      <br>
      those has a little description to go along with it. Apparently all
      of ITS has
      <br>
      taken this test now, and today is kicking off a week of activities
      around
      <br>
      knowing our strengths. There's a 30 minute Zoom meeting about this
      this
      <br>
      afternoon at 1:15 pm
      <br>
      <br>
      I love you Sibylle. I wish you a wonderful day. :)

      I love you,
