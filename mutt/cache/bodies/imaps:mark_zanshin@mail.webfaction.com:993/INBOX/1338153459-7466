Hi mark

I have never actually written out the sheet music for soliloquy but a few pe=
ople have asked so one of these days I will get around to it and I will be s=
ure to send it to you! Meanwhile you could have a go at trying to work it ou=
t by ear. To get you going it starts on g on the d string and goes

G b c d
G b c d eflat d c b c d

All the best
