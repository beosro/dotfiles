Good morning dear Mark, I love you.

Using the U of MN website document is unfortunately bound to be more 
successful than writing something up yourself, something that would 
"heavily plagiarize" their document as you put it - people seem to 
listen better to "official" things than someone's thoughts, no matter 
how valuable those thoughts are.

Thank you for going with me to the concert last night. It *was* good, 
wasn't it :)  Of course Ben Sayevich is a world-class violinist, but I 
also liked the way he looked when he played: he was calm without being 
stiff. I thought he allowed the music to do its thing, didn't have to 
"interpret" ....

I wrote up a little thing for Allen, sent in an email, about 
Ziehgeunerweisen since he seemed so self-conscious about pronouncing it 
(because he had clearly not been taught that it's a three-word compound 
word); how to pronounce it and what it means. He responded with "Wow, 
thanks!" Made me smile.

I am out of zucchini :( and sweet potato. I may go to the store this 
afternoon to look for veggie ideas.

I love you, Sweetheart, and I wish you a good morning. I assume you'll 
be a bit early for lunch so you won't have to hurry to make it back by 1?

I love you,
Sibylle

      Good morning Sweetheart. I love you.
      Thank you very much for listening to me last night, and for
      offering ideas and thoughts about the documentation situation here
      at work. The document I found on the University of Minnesota’s web
      site is a very good outline of how they manage their documentation
      process. I plan on using it to move our process forward.
      Thank you also, for going to last night’s concert. It was very,
      very good. As you said, two world class performers. And a very
      nice program. :)
      Even though it was a fairly short night for me, I feel pretty good
      this morning. My neck isn’t sore any more, and all my other aches
      and pains are pretty quiet this morning. Today is the first day
      this week I haven’t had Aleve with my breakfast.
      Today I’ve got morning stand up at 8:45 am, and then there is an
      open forum for the CISO (Chief Information Security Officer)
      position at 10:15 am. There’s a second open forum this afternoon
      at 1:00 pm for just technical people. I’m going to try to attend
      both.
      Tonight I am looking forward to being on the couch with you and
      watching “Murder on the Orient Express.” :) I’ll stop at Dillons
      and get some bananas and maybe a chocolate brownie from Starbucks
      so that we can make a decadent dessert to go with the movie. :)
