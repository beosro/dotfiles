Cheryl,=20

Before I take myself off the admin page, I looked up a couple of things =
on the dashboard that may be hard to find unless you are used to working =
with wordpress:=20

To edit the =E2=80=9CNews=E2=80=9D sidebar: hover over Appearance, then =
click on Widgets where you can edit the sidebar.=20

To edit =E2=80=9CFind a Teacher=E2=80=9D hover over Tools, then click on =
Little Black Book to edit names and info.=20

To edit =E2=80=9COfficers=E2=80=9D hover over WP-Table Reloaded where =
you find two tables: Officers and Chairs, and Past Presidents.=20

For the =E2=80=9CContact=E2=80=9D page you will need to change the email =
address (at the moment it=E2=80=99s mine, so all communication via =
=E2=80=9CContact=E2=80=9D comes to me and I share it with the group =
then).  Hover over Plugins and select Clean-Contact to edit.=20

Let me know if there is anything else you may have questions about.

Thank you,
Sibylle=20
