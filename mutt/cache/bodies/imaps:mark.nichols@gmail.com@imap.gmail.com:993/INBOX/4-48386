Mark,

Thank you for your help! I have logged into the site and have changed my
password.

I don't think I have any other questions at this time, but I will let you
know if I do. I'll be sure to be in touch when transferring ownership of
the domain name, and perhaps even when we switch hosting sites (just to
make sure everything transfers smoothly). I appreciate you sharing the
costs; that will give me a good idea of what to expect!

Thanks,
Cheryl
