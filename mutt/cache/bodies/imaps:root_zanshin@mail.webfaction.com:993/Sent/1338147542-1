Dear Sibylle,

Good morning Sweetheart, I love you.

It's 7:30 am here, 8:30 am there. I am up and packed and ready to start =
home. Andy is in the shower now, so we'll be leaving here in 30 minutes =
or less. The plan is to find someplace for a quick breakfast and then =
start driving. Andy's done this drive recently and says it'll take us 7 =
1/2 or 8 hours to complete.

I'll send you a text or two along the way to let you know where we are =
at. The weather here is sunny and clear so driving should be good.

We will be careful and safe and I will see you in just a few hours.

I love you very much, Sibylle. :)
