Hello=2C Jason here=2C stepping out from behind the curtain. Tim is enjoyi=
ng a well-earned week off=2C so the newsletter falls to me this week. Toda=
y's issue covers the new young voices of the anti-gun movement=2C some oth=
er newsletters you should be reading=2C teensy origami creations=2C and ev=
en a little Black Panther.


** He Likes You Just the Way You Are
------------------------------------------------------------

Fred Rogers is being honored by the US Postal Service with his own stamp (=
https://kottke.org/18/02/mister-rogers-is-getting-a-us-postage-stamp) . An=
d here he is learning how to breakdance and do the moonwalk (https://kottk=
e.org/18/02/mister-rogers-learns-to-breakdance-and-moonwalk) from 12-year-=
old dancer Jermaine Vaughn. Rogers often tried new things on behalf of his=
 television neighbors=2C even when it made him look awkward or silly. He k=
new the value of not letting what others might think about you get in the=
 way of your curiosity or a new experience.

Why all the Mister Rogers love (https://kottke.org/tag/Fred%20Rogers) this=
 week? Turns out it's the 50th anniversary of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood=
 (https://www.npr.org/2018/02/19/586180373/its-a-beautiful-50th-birthday-f=
or-mister-rogers-neighborhood) =2C a show that had a massive impact on you=
r newsletter correspondent and many other humans.


** Tiny Origami
------------------------------------------------------------

Origami artist Ross Symons makes tiny origami creations and posts them to=
 his Instagram account=2C White on Rice (https://www.instagram.com/white_o=
nrice/) . The account became pretty popular and Symons was able to turn hi=
s hobby into his full-time job (http://white-onrice.com/) doing installati=
ons=2C exhibitions=2C and social media campaigns featuring origami.


** The Odds and The Ends
------------------------------------------------------------

The Parkland students' response (https://www.buzzfeed.com/remysmidt/heres-=
what-its-like-at-the-headquarters-of-the-teens) to the shooting at Marjory=
 Stoneman Douglas High School has hopefully awakened America to the fact t=
hat the NRA is a terrorist organization (https://twitter.com/jkottke/statu=
s/914823472412536832) . Companies who have offered programs or discounts t=
o NRA membership are discontinuing those programs (https://thinkprogress.o=
rg/corporations-nra-f0d8074f2ca7/) and pressure is being applied to politi=
cians who have taken money from the NRA in exchange for votes. (Teen activ=
ist Sarah Chadwick tweeted the other day (https://twitter.com/sarahchad_/s=
tatus/966924331086266369) : "We should change the names of AR-15s to 'Marc=
o Rubio' because they are so easy to buy.") I hope this stuff moves the ne=
edle.

Switzerland is banning boiling lobsters alive (https://kottke.org/18/02/sw=
itzerland-makes-it-illegal-to-boil-a-live-lobster) =2C something that Davi=
d Foster Wallace wrote about in Consider the Lobster (http://theessayexper=
iencefall2013.qwriting.qc.cuny.edu/files/2013/11/Consider-the-Lobster_davi=
d-foster-wallace.pdf) . Inspired by this story=2C I've been listening to W=
allace's collection of the same name on audiobook (http://www.amazon.com/e=
xec/obidos/ASIN/B075RFPW8Y/ref=3Dnosim/0sil8) in the car. The first story=
 is Big Red Son (https://genius.com/David-foster-wallace-big-red-son-annot=
ated) =2C an account of his trip to the AVN Awards=2C the adult film indus=
try's answer to the Oscars=2C narrated by Wallace himself. I would not nec=
essarily recommend listening while driving...I had to pull over at one poi=
nt because I was laughing so hard I couldn't steer straight.

Recommendation: Goodthreads makes my new favorite plain t-shirt (https://w=
ww.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B06XW4XG7Y/ref=3Dnosim/0sil8) . $12/shirt.

As the #MeToo movement continues=2C two powerful conservative men seem imm=
une to the consequences of their bad conduct toward women. New details on=
 Donald Trump's payoffs and cover-ups related to extramarital affairs surf=
aced in a New Yorker piece by Ronan Farrow (https://www.newyorker.com/news=
/news-desk/donald-trump-a-playboy-model-and-a-system-for-concealing-infide=
lity-national-enquirer-karen-mcdougal) and this NY Times piece (https://ww=
w.nytimes.com/2018/02/18/us/politics/michael-cohen-trump.html) . Meanwhile=
 in the judicial branch=2C Jill Abramson called for a reexamination of the=
 evidence against Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and says it's time=
 to seriously talk about his impeachment. Angela Wright-Shannon agrees: "C=
larence Thomas Sexually Harassed Me. Yes=2C He Should Be Impeached." (http=
s://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-wright-shannon-clarence-thomas_us=
_5a8b4b2ae4b0a1d0e12c3095)

Cartoon by Pia Guerra (https://thenib.com/the-kids-are-alright) .

My personal favorite link this week: American teens have had it with this=
 authoritarian crap (https://kottke.org/18/02/american-teens-have-had-it-w=
ith-this-authoritarian-crap) . "The nation's youth=2C raised on The Hunger=
 Games and Harry Potter=2C are reminding the baby boomers that considering=
 what their own parents went through in the Great Depression and World War=
 II=2C they should fucking know better than to slam the door on succeeding=
 generations."

Federal judge: Embedding tweets is copyright infringement (https://www.eff=
=2Eorg/deeplinks/2018/02/federal-judge-says-embedding-tweet-can-be-copyright=
-infringement) . So=2C retweeting is copyright infringement now?

I woke up one day last week feeling tired and uninspired=2C so I asked my=
 Twitter followers for some advice and compiled their responses into 12 wa=
ys to get yourself out of a funk (https://kottke.org/18/02/how-to-get-your=
self-out-of-a-funk)  (spoiler: exercise=2C pets=2C nature=2C sleep).

Alto's Odyssey (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/altos-odyssey/id1182456409=
?mt=3D8&at=3D11l7dq&ct=3Dnoticing) was released this week and=2C pardon th=
e bragging because this is the only video game I've ever been really good=
 at=2C I briefly occupied the #2 slot on the global high score list (https=
://twitter.com/jkottke/status/967260179174699008) . (Currently #3 at press=
 time=2C but I suspect the top score is the result of either a bug or chea=
ting.)

From the kottke.org archives: How to be productive in terrible times (http=
s://kottke.org/17/01/how-to-be-productive-in-terrible-times) and several a=
ccounts of what bullets to do human bodies (https://kottke.org/17/06/what-=
bullets-do-to-bodies) .

I'm still working my way through Charles Mann's fascinating The Wizard and=
 the Prophet (https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0307961699/ref=3Dnos=
im/0sil8) . What are you reading these days? Black Panther comics? (https:=
//kottke.org/18/02/black-panther-a-suggested-comics-reading-list)

My other task for the day is sorting through submissions for the upcoming=
 kottke.org guest editor gig (https://twitter.com/jkottke/status/965697889=
468022784) . Looking through the applicants' blogs=2C projects=2C and pers=
onal sites was a real pleasure...reminded me of good ol' fashioned web sur=
fing=2C which is somewhat of a lost art these days.
