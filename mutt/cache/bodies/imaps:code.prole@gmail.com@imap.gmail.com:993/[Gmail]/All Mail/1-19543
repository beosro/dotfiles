An excellent=2C and practical=2C post with tips on helping a team or organ=
isation actually change its culture. Culture might be a central tenet of d=
evops=2C but finding hands-on discussions can be challenging.

https://zwischenzugs.com/2018/02/24/5-things-i-did-to-change-a-teams-cultu=
re/


It=E2=80=99s one thing to say developers should be on-call for their servi=
ces=2C but how do you enact that change across a team that hasn=E2=80=99t=
 worked in that way before? This post has some ideas and observations.

ystems/


I=E2=80=99d wager most support organisations=2C including development team=
s=2C use a very traditional 3 tier support model. This post explains some=
 of the weaknesses of that approach and explores an alternative; swarming.

-problem-of-becoming-3rd-line-support-and-why-swarming-is-a-better-alterna=

An in-depth look at time-series data=2C and how you can use it across an o=
rganisation rather than just as a detail for a monitoring system.

l-technology-for-the-enterprise-part-i/


The operations side of serverless is still a new field I feel=2C one of th=
e specific areas worthy of discussion is security. This post provides a go=
od overview of the current state of affairs and challenges to overcome.

A look at patterns for organising Terraform code=2C focused on building a=
 workflow that can scale across teams and more complex organisations.

https://www.contino.io/insights/a-model-for-scaling-terraform-workflows-in=
-a-large-complex-organization


A nice walkthrough of the Prometheus monitoring tool=2C with nice diagrams=
 showing the basic architecture and instructions for how to install and co=
nfigure it.

https://kjanshair.github.io/2018/02/20/prometheus-monitoring/


Kubernetes as a large number of concepts=2C at various levels of abstracti=
on. Deployments sit fairly high in the stack=2C and this post explains whe=
n and how they are used for gradual rollouts of containers.
