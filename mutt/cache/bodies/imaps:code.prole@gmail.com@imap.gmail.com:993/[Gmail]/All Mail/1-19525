a kottke=E2=80=A4org newsletter written by Tim Carmody
http://mailchi.mp/kottke/noticing-the-worlds-wonders-amidst-its-horrors-21=
82018?e=3D779a416347

Welcome to the seventh edition of Noticing=2C rounding up the best new (an=
d more than a few old) things of the week. This is our second time around=
 experimenting with a Sunday delivery date rather than Friday; please let=
 us know what you think about it!


** Twenty years later=2C still Jason from the block
------------------------------------------------------------
You should definitely check out Jason's interview in Nieman Lab (http://ww=
w.niemanlab.org/2018/02/last-blog-standing-last-guy-dancing-how-jason-kott=
ke-is-thinking-about-kottke-org-at-20/) about writing kottke.org for twent=
y years=2C and the state and trajectory of the blogosphere.


My favorite part is where he talks about the site's anti-mission mission:

I think that it=E2=80=99s been really hard=2C the last couple of years=2C=
 to cover anything =E2=80=94 I don=E2=80=99t know how to say this in a way=
 that isn=E2=80=99t going to get all weirdly interpreted =E2=80=94 it=E2=
=80=99s been hard to cover anything but things that are serious. Because=
=2C you know=2C a lot of people =E2=80=94 I think very rightly =E2=80=94 f=
eel that if you=E2=80=99re someone who thinks the world is coming down aro=
und all of us=2C that you should be on a mission to try to fix that. And I=
 think that there are plenty of sites and plenty of media outlets and plen=
ty of people who are oriented in that direction and moving in that directi=
on.

But I don=E2=80=99t think kottke.org is one of those things. I think that=
 the site is much more about things that are a little bit more =E2=80=94 I=
 don=E2=80=99t want to say hopeful=2C but a lot of it is=2C like=2C look a=
t this cool thing. Look at what humans can do when they have enough time a=
nd energy and whatnot to do them! When you called=2C I was had just been w=
atching the SpaceX thing. Seeing those two booster rockets land at the sam=
e time (https://youtu.be/sB_nEtZxPog?t=3D9m15s) blew my mind. I was just s=
itting here=2C yelling=2C like=2C oh my god!

There has to be room in our culture for that type of stuff =E2=80=94 that=
 stuff that is inspirational and aspirational =E2=80=94 because it provide=
s some sort of hope that we can actually have more of that in our lives=2C=
 rather than less.

I freely admit that this is something Jason does as a blogger way better t=
han I do (along with writing fewer words more often). I think I look at th=
e world and mostly think less "oh my god!" and more "how in the hell does=
 that work?" But I think the two of them have to be complimentary. Learnin=
g begins in wonder (the Greeks would call it thauma) as much or more than=
 in criticism (skepsis). And Jason and kottke.org always bring me back to=
 wonder.


** The world and its wonders
------------------------------------------------------------
Consider skating on freshly frozen black lake ice (https://kottke.org/18/0=
2/the-wonderful-sounds-of-black-ice-skating) =2C and the wondrous sounds t=
hat emits. Think about that for a moment: what could be more mundane=2C mo=
re embedded in the history of human experience through most of the world=
=2C than frozen water? And yet=2C we're still able to find ways to examine=
 it that are new and revealing.

Photography is quite a bit younger than ice skating=2C and it's nontrivial=
 to get enough light underwater to get great photographs=2C but these winn=
ers of the 2018 underwater photographer contest (https://kottke.org/18/02/=
winners-of-the-2018-underwater-photographer-of-the-year-contest) manage to=
 show how much wonder is beneath that surface we barely skate upon.

Digging beneath the surface in a different way is this other science photo=
graphy contest winner: a photograph of a single atom of strontium=2C (http=
s://kottke.org/18/02/photo-of-a-single-atom-wins-science-photo-contest) su=
spended in an ionic trap=2C illuminated by a blue-violet laser. Think abou=
t what our machines can do=2C and all the elements of the universe they ca=
n reveal.


** The world and its horrors
------------------------------------------------------------
And then you think about what we mostly use our machines to do=2C and thos=
e wonders seem so much rarer and precious. Satellite data shows that sea l=
evels will be rising by four inches or more every decade by 2100 (https://=
twitter.com/kottke/status/963531225662042113) ; this map of the world with=
 global temperatures four degrees warmer (https://kottke.org/18/02/a-map-o=
f-the-world-after-four-degrees-of-warming) only shows a few areas lost to=
 flooding (never mind that those little dots of red include millions of pe=
ople)=2C but huge continental belts lost to desertification.

Meanwhile=2C many of us continue to live in the United States of Guns (htt=
ps://kottke.org/18/02/the-united-states-of-guns-3) =2C where spectacular m=
ass shootings at schools and churches and 33=2C000 gun deaths per annum ar=
e just part of the cost of doing business (https://twitter.com/kottke/stat=
us/964153429642874881) . We ride in high-speed mechanized death machines (=
https://kottke.org/18/02/why-speeding-is-so-dangerous) =2C and that's only=
 changing (if it actually does) because some already rich people will find=
 a way to make money off the transformation.

At some point=2C we bound ourselves=2C like Odysseus to the mast of his sh=
ip=2C only in reverse. We weren't afraid the siren's song would drive us c=
razy; we seem to be afraid it might strike us sane and make us give up the=
 things we've come to enjoy.


** So what's good?
------------------------------------------------------------
Black Panther is a great film=2C even if it isn't exactly the movie I want=
ed it to be (https://kottke.org/18/02/a-short-melancholy-review-of-black-p=
anther) .

These portraits of Barack and Michelle Obama (https://kottke.org/18/02/the=
-official-painted-portraits-of-barack-and-michelle-obama) are amazing.

These audiobooks (https://kottke.org/18/02/the-best-audiobooks-for-kids) a=
re outstanding=2C especially if you have kids.

Alto's Odyssey=2C the sequel to Alto's Adventure=2C (https://kottke.org/18=
/02/really-excited-for-altos-odyssey-the-sequel-to-altos-adventure) looks=
 like it could be fantastic.

Maybe some day we'll find our way off that mast=2C and make our way home.

You should definitely check out <a href=3D"http://www.niemanlab.org/2018/0=

 twenty years=2C and the state and trajectory of the blogosphere.<br>

<p style=3D"margin: 0 0 15px;">My favorite part is where he talks about th=
e site&#39;s anti-mission mission:</p>

<blockquote style=3D"color: #333;padding-left: 25px;padding-right: 25px;ma=
rgin: 0 0 15px;max-width: 100%;">
<p style=3D"margin: 0 0 15px;">I think that it&rsquo;s been really hard=2C=
 the last couple of years=2C to cover anything &mdash; I don&rsquo;t know=
 how to say this in a way that isn&rsquo;t going to get all weirdly interp=
reted &mdash; it&rsquo;s been hard to cover anything but things that are s=
erious. Because=2C you know=2C a lot of people &mdash; I think very rightl=
y &mdash; feel that if you&rsquo;re someone who thinks the world is coming=
 down around all of us=2C that you should be on a mission to try to fix th=
at. And I think that there are plenty of sites and plenty of media outlets=
 and plenty of people who are oriented in that direction and moving in tha=
t direction.</p>

<p style=3D"margin: 0 0 15px;">But I don&rsquo;t think kottke.org is one o=
f those things. I think that the site is much more about things that are a=
 little bit more &mdash; I don&rsquo;t want to say <em>hopeful</em>=2C but=
 a lot of it is=2C like=2C <em>look at this cool thing</em>. Look at what=
 humans can do when they have enough time and energy and whatnot to do the=
m! When you called=2C I was had just been watching the SpaceX thing. <a hr=
ef=3D"https://youtu.be/sB_nEtZxPog?t=3D9m15s" style=3D"color: #000000;font=
-weight: bold;">Seeing those two booster rockets land at the same time</a>=
 <em>blew my mind</em>. I was just sitting here=2C yelling=2C like=2C oh m=
y god!</p>

<p style=3D"margin: 0 0 15px;">There has to be room in our culture for tha=
t type of stuff &mdash; that stuff that is inspirational and aspirational=
 &mdash;&nbsp;because it provides some sort of hope that we can actually h=
ave more of that in our lives=2C rather than less.</p>
</blockquote>
I freely admit that this is something Jason does as a blogger way better t=
han I do (along with writing fewer words more often). I think I look at th=
e world and mostly think less &quot;oh my god!&quot; and more &quot;how in=
 the hell does that work?&quot; But I think the two of them have to be com=
plimentary. Learning begins in wonder (the Greeks would call it thauma) as=
 much or more than in criticism (skepsis). And Jason and kottke.org always=
 bring me back to wonder.

 that emits. Think about that for a moment: what could be more mundane=2C=
 more embedded in the history of human experience through most of the worl=
d=2C than frozen water? And yet=2C we&#39;re still able to find ways to ex=
amine it that are new and revealing.<br>

Photography is quite a bit younger than ice skating=2C and it&#39;s nontri=
vial to get enough light underwater to get great photographs=2C but these=

Digging beneath the surface in a different way is this other science photo=

And then you think about what we mostly use our machines to do=2C and thos=
e wonders seem so much rarer and precious. Satellite data shows that <a hr=

At some point=2C we bound ourselves=2C like Odysseus to the mast of his sh=
